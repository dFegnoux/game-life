# game-life

A simple life game in javascript.

There is for now a few actions and options:

`lifeGame._init({tableSize: 40, speed: 100});`

**TODO :**
- Refactor code
- Use less html and let javascript creates needed elements like container and actions buttons
- Use more options to customize the game
- Detect when previous and current states are the same to automaticaly stop simulation
